;; * a turn looks like

;; ** compare the ranks of the cards
;; *** one ranks higher - the player who played the higher rank moves both cards to the "bottom" of their stack
;; *** ranks are the same
;; **** each player takes the "top" card from their stack and ignore the value
;; **** take the next top card from each player's stack and re-evaluate the compare
